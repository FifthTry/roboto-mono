# Roboto Mono: FPM Font Package

This repository contains a [fpm font package](https://fpm.dev/featured/fonts/) containing [Google Font: 
Roboto Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Mono/about?query=roboto).

Arya is a Devanagari and Latin type family. It originated with Modular InfoTech's 1201, and was made more smooth. The 
new and original Latin design is intended to match the Devanagari in weight and and size with an unusual high-contrast 
sans serif design.

Designers: Eduardo Tunni, Principal design

## How To Use This Font In Your FPM Package:
